# Product

## Overview

This project serves as a foundational template for new software development initiatives. It is designed to be a standardized, AI-ready starting point that accelerates setup and ensures consistency across projects.

## Problem

Starting new software projects often involves repetitive setup and configuration. Without a standardized base, projects can develop inconsistent structures, coding standards, and workflows, leading to long-term maintenance challenges. This base project aims to solve that by providing a pre-configured, best-practices foundation.

## How it Works

This is not a functional application. It is a repository template containing a pre-defined structure, configuration files, and documentation to guide development. When a new project is initiated, it should be started from this template to inherit all the foundational elements.

## User Experience Goals

- **For Developers**: To provide a clear, simple, and efficient starting point that reduces initial setup time and enforces project-wide standards from day one.
- **For AI Agents**: To provide a structured and well-documented environment that is easy to understand and work with, enabling effective AI-driven development.
