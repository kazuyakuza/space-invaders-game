## Overview

This is a base project designed to serve as a foundational template for future AI-agent driven development. It is pre-configured with essential rules, workflows, and structures optimized for collaboration between human developers and AI agents (specifically Kilo Code).

## Core Requirements

- **Foundation**: Provide a clean, structured starting point for new projects.
- **AI-Readiness**: Include necessary configurations (like `.kilocode` and `.ai-agent` directories) to enable immediate and effective AI agent participation.
- **Standardization**: Establish a baseline for coding standards, workflows (e.g., Git Flow, Task Handling), and documentation practices.
- **Memory Bank**: Integrate the Memory Bank system to ensure persistent context and knowledge management across sessions.

## Goals

- Reduce setup time for new projects.
- Ensure consistency across different projects started from this base.
- Demonstrate best practices for "AI-Agent Driven" development.

## Project Scope

- This repository is a **base project to use later**. It is not a functional application itself but a scaffolding tool.
- It contains configuration files, rule definitions, and workflow documentation.
- It does not contain specific business logic or application code.

## Important Note for AI Agents

All agents working on this project must adhere to the workflows and rules outlined in the [AI Agent Onboarding document](../../../AGENTS.md). This is not optional.

Before starting any task, you must:

1. **Review `AGENTS.md`**: This file is the primary source of instructions for agents.
2. **Follow Workflows**: It is crucial to follow the procedures defined in `.ai-agent/WORKFLOWS.md`, especially the .kilocode/workflows/critical-workflow.md

Failure to comply with these instructions will result in incorrect or incomplete work.
