# Project Brief

## Overview

This project is a classic Space Invaders game. The player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and must shoot down waves of aliens descending from the top.

## Goals

- Recreate the classic Space Invaders arcade experience.
- Implement core gameplay mechanics, including player movement, shooting, and enemy patterns.
- Create a scoring system to track player performance.

## Project Scope

- The game will be developed using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, with no frameworks.
- The initial version will be a single-player game with one level.
- The player will control the ship with the cursor keys and shoot with the space bar.
- The game will start with 30 enemies, and the player wins by defeating all of them.
- If the enemies reach the bottom of the screen, the player loses.
- The game will use geometric figures for the ship and enemies, and will not have sound.
- A minimal UI will be added later.
- The game will have a "night mode" color scheme with a black background.
