# Architecture

## System Architecture

As a project template, there is no pre-defined system architecture. The architecture will be defined by the specific project that is built upon this foundation.

## Source Code Paths

- `src/`: This directory is reserved for all source code. Currently, it is empty.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Standardization**: The project emphasizes a standardized structure to ensure consistency.
- **AI-Agent Readiness**: The inclusion of `.kilocode` and `.ai-agent` directories is a key decision to facilitate AI-driven development from the start.

## Design Patterns

No specific design patterns are implemented at this stage. The choice of design patterns will depend on the requirements of the project that uses this template.
