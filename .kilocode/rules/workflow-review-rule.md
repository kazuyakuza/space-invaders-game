# Workflow Review Rule

## Guidelines

- During task planning, AI agents must review the workflows files listed in `.ai-agent/WORKFLOWS.md`
- This review ensures that agents are aware of defined workflows and can follow them appropriately.
- If a workflow exists for the task, the agent must follow it strictly.
