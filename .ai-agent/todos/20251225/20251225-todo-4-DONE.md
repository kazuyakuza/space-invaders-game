- [DONE] fix bug: the enemies movement is wrong. when they reach the edge of the screen, they should wrap around to the opposite side. Now, they go to the bottom of the screen directly, doing the player lose.\n- [DONE] instead of 3 rows and 10 cols, make enemies be in 5 rows and 6 cols.\n- [DONE] make the game space more big.\n- [DONE] on game over state, make "enter" key restart the game. add a note below the "game over" title to indicate this.\n- [DONE] add a padding in the game space, so neither enemies nor the player can touch the line of the game boundaries.\n- [DONE] add a score counter that increases by 10 points for each enemy destroyed.
