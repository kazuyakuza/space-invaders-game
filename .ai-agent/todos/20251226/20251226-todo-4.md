# [DONE] modify the levels.json structure

instead of an array of levels, make it an object with level numbers as keys. So a level X can be defined without defining all levels from 1 to X-1.

# [DONE] implement new feature: enemies life

- enemies has a number of how many bullets is required to be killed. This number is showed inside its square image.
- add to the levels.json structure the property to indicate how many shoots requires a enemy to be killed.

# [DONE] implement bug level.json file feature

- for each property that can be defined in the levels.json, the property key (for example "enemyCount") can have a plus symbol (ie. "+") prefix
- if current defined level is X, that includes the plus symbol.
  - Example: { "+enemyCount": 1 }
- then look at the previous level < X defined with static properties. This means has not a "+" in its keys.
Lets say this found level is Y.
  - Example: { "enemyCount": 30, ...other properties }
- then take the values of the found level Y as a base
  - Example: { "enemyCount": 30, ...other properties }
- for each property in the level Y, sum up the value of the same named property in the level X.
  - Example: { "enemyCount": 30+1, ...other properties }
- finally use the result to set up the level X
- when a level > X has not definition, it should use the level Y as base, and sum up the properties defined in level X for each level between them. Let see with an example:
  - level Y: { "enemyCount": 30, ...other properties }
  - level X: { "+enemyCount": 1, ...other properties }
  - level X+1: { "enemyCount": 30+1+1, ...other properties }
  - level X+2: { "enemyCount": 30+1+1+1, ...other properties }
  - level X+3: { "enemyCount": 30+1+1+1+1, ...other properties }
