- [DONE] remove spacingX, spacingY and dropDistance properties from the levels.json file. Make them constant values in the code.
- [DONE] move constants code values to a constants.ts file.
- [DONE] review "npm run build" errors, and fix them.
- [DONE] add to the levels.json file a property to indicate the amount of enemies per level. In reality, the row & col numbers just specify the spaces where a enemy may spawn. However, if there are more spaces than amount of enemies, the game will only spawn that amount of enemies, randomly distributed across the available spaces. And, if there are fewer spaces than enemies, the game will spawn enemies in all available spaces.
