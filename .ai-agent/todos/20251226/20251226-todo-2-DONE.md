[DONE] - the enemies movement velocity must increase by 0.1% each time the go down a row in the game area.
[DONE] - the game starts at level 0, which is the base level we have now. That is 30 enemies in 5 rows and 6 cols, and each one is killed by a single bullet, and start a base velocity of 1.0. Important: the velocity is about the left-right movement only.
[DONE] - Implement a way to config each level:
  [DONE] - the game will have infinity levels, and at a certain levels, some attributes of the enemies will change, such as the number of enemies, the number of rows and columns, the number of bullets required to kill each enemy (to be implemented later), the base velocity, and some others to be defined later.
  [DONE] - to mark when a certain attribute changes, create a json file where handle this levels configuration.
  [DONE] - for example, we may have a property "level-10" in the json, and in it has properties like "enemy-count", "rows", "cols", "base-velocity", etc.
  [DONE] - when a level to be loaded has not configuration in the json file, it will use the configuration of the previous level that exist in the file.
[DONE] - after the player kills all enemies of current level, enemies of the next level spawn at the top of the game area, and immediately starts moving downward.
[DONE] - show the current game level at the top right of the game area.
