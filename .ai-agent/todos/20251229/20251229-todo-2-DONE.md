# modify player lives label

Move the player lives label to the bottom right.
Instead of show a text and number, use dots to show the current lives of the player.
The first dot should be at the bottom right of the game area. Put the next dot to the left of the previous one, with a small space between them.

# modify game over behaviour

The enemies must reach bottom of the game area to trigger the game over state.
