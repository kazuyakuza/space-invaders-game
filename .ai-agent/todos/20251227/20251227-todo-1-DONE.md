- add a label at the top middle of the game area with "Press ESC to pause". Only show this when the game is on play status.
- modify the player sprite to be a triangle
- modify the enemy sprites to be pentagons
- when the game is paused, add the option to press "R" to restart the game. Add a label at the top middle of the game area with "Press R to restart".
- redefine the enemies so we have 4 types:
  - red color is the current one. just goes moves horizontally, and goes down when touches the edge of the game area.
  - yellow color is a new one. appears at the top of the game area, in a random position along the x-axis, and moves downwards.
  - orange color is another new one. appears at the bottom of the game area, in a random position along the x-axis. it never moves, and shoots bullets randomly. This shoots doesn't affects the other enemies.
  - violet color is another new one. appears at the middle of the game area, in a random position along the x-axis. it never moves. it is structured by 3 pentagons, with one on the center of it, and the other 2 at the sides (horizontally), and slightly over the one at the center.
  - important: next we are going to define how a level can be configured to have this enemies types.
- modifies the levels.json, so we can set enemies types to the levels:
  - lets add an optional enemyTypes property for the levels.
  - this property has a property for each enemy type, and the value is a number that represents the percentage of enemies of that type that should appear in the level. For example, if the level has 30 enemies, and the enemyTypes property is {"red": 50, "yellow": 30, "orange": 10, "violet": 10}, then 50% of the enemies will be red, 30% will be yellow, 10% will be orange, and 10% will be violet.
  - when the property is undefined, then the default value is to have only the red enemies, which is {"red": 100}
