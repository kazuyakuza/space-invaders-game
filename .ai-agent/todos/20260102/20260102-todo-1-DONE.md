# [DONE] Modify levels config and loading behaviour
- Remove the "+" properties from levels.json.
- Ensure all levels are explicitly defined with all required properties.
- Lookup the level config to load in the levels.json file.
- If it exists, then if any of the properties are undefined, then throw an error. If not, then just load it.
- If the level doesn't exists in the levels.json file, then throw an error.
