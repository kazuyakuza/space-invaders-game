## new kamikaze enemy blue color [DONE]

Add new enemy, which should start spawning from level 36.
This new one is blue color, and is visually a hexagon.
It spawns and moves with the red enemies type.
The block of red and blue enemies must randomly set position for each type.
I mean, first calculate how many row, cols, reds amount and blues amount.
Then, iterate in the grid, and in each cell choose randomly between red/blue enemy.
Until you have no more of one of them, then add the remaining enemies in the next cells, until there is also no more enemies to add.
The behaviour of this enemies is special. Whenever receives a shoot, even if has health = 1, it explodes in place.
Explodes means visually that it just disappears, ie. killed like any other enemy.
However, when it explodes it also shoots 3 bullets to the player.
Each bullet has a position target: one at the middle of the bottom game area, the other 2 at the middle of the 1/3 left and right portions of the game area.
This bullets damage the player if it touches its ship.

## player's market space [DONE]

To the "Press ESC to Pause" label, add "& Access Market".

When the game is on pause, below the label "PAUSED - Press ESC to Resume", add an area where list items the player can buy.

All the selling items must be show in a grid, with:

- an index
- a name
- a symbol reference
- a price

The price is points (the score). So, the player use points to buy any item.

If an item's price is 1000 points, and the player buy it, then the score of the player is reduced by that amount.

To buy, the player can press number keys from 0 to 9.

Add a "Market" title, a note about the cost are points, and another note to "Press keys from 0 to 9 to buy".

When the user press the key, if has the required points, then the sell is directly confirmed.

### The first item to sell is "Life"

- index: 0
- name: "+1 Life"
- symbol reference: green dot
- price: 25k

## player's eletric hedge defense

This is a buyable item in the market:

- index: 1
- name: "Hedge DEF"
- symbol reference: green horizontal line
- price: 5k

This defense is a tiny green line (like 1 or 2 pixels), that goes from lef to right in the game area.
The first place to add this defense is some pixels high to the place where the player's ship moves.
Up to 10 hedge defenses can be added, each one must me more high than the last one.

When an enemy touches a hedge defense, the defense and all enemies touches it are killed.
It doesn't matter how much health points has the enemy, it is directly killed.
Enemies killed this way also add points to the player.
