[DONE] - modify player shooting behaviour: instead of the player need to press the space bar for shooting, lets make the player shoot automatically all the time the game is in play status. the current bullet that player shoots is the default shooting gun.
[DONE] - fix bug: for the non red enemies, check the spawn logic so the never spawn in the same position, or too much near.
[DONE] - fix bug: when load level configuration, and level has a "+speed" property configuration, the code must found the previous level that has no "+" properties set. Then calculate the speed as: `level+speed` * (level - 1).
[DONE] - fix bug: when load level configuration, and level has a "+enemyHealth" property configuration, the code must found the previous level that has no "+" properties set. Then calculate the enemy health as: 1 + Math.floor(`level.+enemyHealth` * level - 1).
[DONE] - new feature: add a timer at the left of the level label. it must start at 00:00 (minutes:seconds) and count up. When the game is paused, the timer should pause too.
[DONE] - new feature: when the player completes a level, it gains point with the next calculation: `points = level * 10`. And, if the player didn't loose a life in the level, double the points, so `points = level * 20`.
