# fix wrong start level

the game must start at level 1, not 0.

# fix timer

the timer was incorrectly implemented. It must start at "00:00" (counting "minutes:seconds"). Currently counts "seconds:miliseconds", which is incorrect.

# fix level configuration loading

fix the logic of load level configuration from the levels.json file. This is still not working as expected.
The problem is when the level is not completely defined, and use properties that start with "+" symbol.

Note: property with "+" symbol means that the property key name has a plus symbol prefix.

Lets explain clearly the expected behaviour.

## There are two options to set up a level configuration

1. the level exists in the configuration file: when the level is found in the config file, then the properties defined in it are used to load the level. Note: how to decide about the properties are defined below.

2. the level don't exists in the configuration file: when the level is not found in the config file, then we need to find the previous level that has any properties defined (again, how to handle properties are defined below). So, for example, if current level is 20, and is not defined in the config file, and the file has the level 12 defined, then we use the level 12 properties as the configuration for the level 20.

## There are two options to define a level's properties

1. all properties without "+": when all properties are defined without "+", then just load the configuration with that properties.
2. properties with "+": when properties are defined with a "+", that means that the level configuration must be calculated, which is explained below.

## How to calculate a level configuration with "+"

1. We got the current level config.
2. We need to find a previous level that has a definition of properties without "+".
So, for example, if the configuration is like:

```js
"67": {
  "cols": 12,
  "enemyCount": 120,
  "rows": 10,
  "enemyTypes": {
    "red": 25,
    "yellow": 25,
    "orange": 25,
    "violet": 25
  },
  "speed": 3.3,
  "health": 201
},
"68": {
  "+speed": 0.05,
  "+enemyHealth": 3
},
"76": {
  "+speed": 0.06,
  "+enemyHealth": 4
},
```

If we need to load level 76, then we need to use the level 67 as a base, because the immediate previous defined level 68 has properties with "+".

1. To the base level (67 in the example) we need to calculate the values for the properties that the level to load (76 in the example) has with "+".
Currently we are using only next properties with "+" symbol:

- +speed: to calculate the speed for the level to load, we need to do `baseLevel.speed + (levelToLoad.+speed * (levelToLoad - baseLevel))`. So, in the example we do: `level76.speed = level67.speed + (level76.+speed * (76 - 67))`
- +enemyHealth: to calculate the enemyHealth for the level to load, we need to do `baseLevel.enemyHealth + Math.floor(levelToLoad.+enemyHealth * (levelToLoad - baseLevel))`. So, in the example we do: `level76.enemyHealth = level67.enemyHealth + Math.floor(level76.+enemyHealth * (76 - 67))`

1. When finally have all final properties, then load the level

## Implementation

After said all that, work on

- fix the level load configuration
- update the game tests files properly
